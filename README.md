# Challenge

## Technologies
- Clean Swift Architecture
- Concurrency framework (async/await)
- Core Data
- No 3rd Party libraries ❤️

## How to use

### Adding objects
1. Press + button for adding objects (cells contain UITextfields)
2. Tap Save for adding an object (it's saved to Core Data)

### Managing objects list
1. Filter / Search list of objects via search controller
2. Tap on any object in the list to edit object
3. Swipe left on any object to remove it.

### Manage object relations
1. Add relations to other objects by tapping + button on an object's the edit screen
2. Swipe left to delete relation to other object

## What's missing?
- Tests
- Refactoring (some parts slightly violate Clean Swift Architecture)
